retail-4-5-4-calendar
=====================

Program that generates the retail 4-5-4 calendar dates that correspond to the Gregorian calendar.  
This program starts at January 30, 2000 (Gregorian) because that is Day 1 Week 1 of the 2000 Retail 4-5-4 calendar. 
Due to the nature of the pattern that the 4-5-4 calendar is generated by, it must start generating from 
Jan 30th 2000.

weeks in month (not really necessary), and day of month.
